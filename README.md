# Face_Recognition
Machine Learning using Python

Face recognition is a biometric identification technique that uses unique characteristics of an individual's face to identify them. Most facial recognition systems work by comparing the face print to a database of known faces. If there's a match, the system can identify the individual. However, if the face print isn't in the database, the system can't identify the individual.
